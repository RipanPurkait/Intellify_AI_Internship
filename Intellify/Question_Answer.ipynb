How does the presence of McDonald's franchises impact the geographical coverage of the Big Mac Index?\n","Question:  1. What is the purpose of the Big Mac Index?\n","Answer:  The purpose of the Big Mac Index is to calculate an implied exchange rate between two currencies and provide a method to analyze a currency's level of under/over-valuation against a base currency.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","Question:  2. Who introduced the Big Mac Index in The Economist in September 1986?\n","Answer:  The Big Mac Index was introduced in The Economist in September 1986 by Pam Woodall.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","Question:  3. How is the implied exchange rate calculated using the Big Mac Index?\n","Answer:  The implied exchange rate using the Big Mac Index is calculated by dividing the price of a Big Mac in a foreign country by the price of a Big Mac in a base country. Typically, the base country used is the United States. This calculation provides an estimate of the exchange rate between the two currencies based on the price of a Big Mac in each country.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","Question:  4. How can the Big Mac Index be used to analyze a currency's level of under/over-valuation?\n","Answer:  The Big Mac Index can be used to analyze a currency's level of under/over-valuation by comparing the implied exchange rate calculated using the Big Mac prices in different countries to the actual exchange rate. If the implied exchange rate is greater than the actual exchange rate, then the currency is considered overvalued against the base currency. Conversely, if the implied exchange rate is less than the actual exchange rate, then the currency is considered undervalued against the base currency. This comparison helps determine whether a currency is overvalued or undervalued based on the relative prices of Big Macs in different countries.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","Question:  5. What are some limitations of the Big Mac Index methodology?\n","Answer:  Some limitations of the Big Mac Index methodology include:\n","\n","1. Geographical coverage: The index is limited by the geographical coverage of McDonald's restaurants, which may not be present in all countries. This can lead to a lack of representation of certain economies.\n","\n","2. Local market factors: The relative cost of a Big Mac can be influenced by factors such as local production and delivery costs, advertising expenses, and the local market's willingness to pay. These factors can vary significantly from country to country.\n","\n","3. Non-tradable goods: The index may not account for non-tradable goods and services, such as property costs, which can differ between countries and are not necessarily reflective of relative currency values.\n","\n","4. Commercial strategies: McDonald's may use different commercial strategies in different countries, leading to significant differences in product prices. This can impact the accuracy of the index.\n","\n","5. Variability within countries: Prices of Big Macs can vary greatly within a country, such as between urban and rural areas. This variability can affect the overall accuracy of the index.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","Question:  6. What is the significance of the Big Mac Pay Gap Index introduced by Trusaic in 2022?\n","Answer:  The Big Mac Pay Gap Index introduced by Trusaic in 2022 shows how much more a Big Mac would cost you, after adjusting the menu price of a Big Mac to reflect whatever pay gap you may face. This index aims to highlight the impact of pay gaps on the cost of goods, specifically using the Big Mac as a reference point.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","Question:  7. How did the government of Argentina manipulate the price of Big Macs to influence the country's performance on the Big Mac Index?\n","Answer:  The government of Argentina, specifically Secretary of Commerce Guillermo Moreno, reportedly forced McDonald's to sell the Big Mac at an artificially low price to manipulate the country's performance on the Big Mac Index. This unusual pricing strategy was implemented to understate the country's true inflation rate and create a false impression of economic stability.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","Question:  8. How do the nutritional values and ingredients of Big Macs vary in different countries?\n","Answer:  The nutritional values and ingredients of Big Macs can vary in different countries. For example, in India, where beef is not commonly consumed due to religious reasons, McDonald's offers a Chicken Maharaja Mac as a substitute for the traditional Big Mac. Additionally, the size, weight, and nutritional content of the Big Mac can differ from country to country. For instance, the Australian version of the Big Mac has fewer calories compared to the Canadian version. It's important to note that not all Big Macs are exclusively beef, and the ingredients can vary based on local preferences and regulations.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","Question:  9. What factors can influence the price of a Big Mac in different countries, according to the text?\n","Answer:  According to the text, factors that can influence the price of a Big Mac in different countries include local production and delivery costs, advertising costs, market demand, commercial strategies, local wages, ingredient prices, and local economic factors. Additionally, factors like social status, competition, import duties, and taxes can also play a role in determining the price of a Big Mac in different countries.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","Question:  10. How does the presence of McDonald's franchises impact the geographical coverage of the Big Mac Index?\n","Answer:  The presence of McDonald's franchises impacts the geographical coverage of the Big Mac Index because the index relies on the availability of McDonald's restaurants to compare the prices of Big Macs across different countries. In areas where McDonald's is not present, the index cannot be applied. For example, in Africa, the coverage of the Big Mac Index is limited because McDonald's is only present in a few countries like Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, and Mauritius. This limitation affects the index's ability to provide a comprehensive comparison of purchasing power parity in regions where McDonald's is not established.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"summary":"{\n  \"name\": \"df\",\n  \"rows\": 10,\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"9.
